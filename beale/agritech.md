Based on the search results provided, I can offer some insights on recent trends in Agritech patent filings:

## Overall Increase in Agritech AI Patents

There has been a significant increase in artificial intelligence (AI) patent filings in the Agritech sector in recent years:

- By 2019, AI patent filings in Agritech had increased more than tenfold compared to 2015 levels[2].
- The growth in Agritech AI patents started a few years later than similar growth seen in the transport sector[2].

## Shift in Technology Focus

The types of technologies being patented in Agritech have evolved:

- From 2000-2014, most Agritech AI patents related to organic/biochemistry and biological material testing methods[2].
- More recently, Agritech AI patents have focused on:
  - Control systems for autonomous vehicles (e.g. automatic pilot and guidance systems for agricultural machines)
  - Pattern recognition technology for vehicle navigation and crop monitoring[2]

## High Allowance Rate

The Agriculture category had the second-highest allowance rate for AI patent applications at the European Patent Office, suggesting innovations in this area are likely to be protectable under EPO guidelines[2].

## Geographic Trends

- China has been the most active jurisdiction for Agritech IoT patent filings, with roughly three times as many patent families compared to Europe[1].
- The United States was the second most active jurisdiction, with twice as many patent families as Europe[1].

While these trends indicate significant growth in Agritech patent filings, especially related to AI and IoT technologies, it's important to note that the most recent specific data provided is from 2019-2020. The exact numbers for the last 3 years (2021-2023) are not explicitly stated in the given search results.
